### Hi there, I am YG ğŸ‘‹

I am a person who likes Internet technology very much. I have more than 20 years of working experience in IT related fields and have been engaged in software development of B/S structure, including demand analysis, architecture design, development and continuous delivery. I have also been engaged in network structure design, server management etc. covering a wide range, which is one of the reasons why I like all kinds of new technologies very much. I am glad to know more friends here and learn interesting things from each other!
